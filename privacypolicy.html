          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <hr />

          <h2>SECTION 1 – WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
          <hr />

          <p>
            When you visit our website and buy a product/service, as part of the process, we collect the personal
            information about you, such as GST Registration, Phone and Email address etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you browse our website, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in
            order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.
          </p>

          <h2>SECTION 2 – CONSENT</h2>
          <hr />

          <p>How do you get my consent?</p>

          <p>
            When you provide us with personal information to complete a payment you are making to us, verify your credit
            card or bank details and finally complete the transaction, we imply that you consent to our collecting it
            and using it for providing that service / product to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we ask for your additional information for any other reason, we will provide you detailed explanation
            about why it is needed or what we will do with that information. You have the opportunity to back off if you
            are not convinced that the information is not relevant to the requirement.
          </p>

          <h2>SECTION 3 – DISCLOSURE</h2>
          <hr />

          <p>
            We will disclose any data or information we obtain from transactions with you - unless required by the law.
          </p>

          <h2>SECTION 4 – PAYMENT</h2>
          <hr />

          <p>
            We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store your card data on the servers. The data is
            encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing payment. Your
            transaction data is only used as long as is necessary to complete your donation transaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            We believe that our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security
            Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
          </p>

          <p>
            PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our service providers.
          </p>

          <p>For more insight, you may also want to read terms and conditions of Razorpay on https://razorpay.com</p>

          <h2>SECTION 5 – THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>
          <hr />

          <p>
            In general, we believe that the third-party service providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose
            your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction
            processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them
            for your donation related transactions.
          </p>

          <p>
            For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in
            which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
          </p>

          <p>
            In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located within
            a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves
            the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the
            jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer
            governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.
